# Ariake Dark Syntax theme

Ariake Dark is a Jetbrains (Phpstorm, Webstorm etc.) theme inspired by the [Atom theme](https://github.com/pathtrk/ariake-dark-syntax) of the same name.

This theme is inspired by Japanese traditional colours.

## Install

**OSX**

1. Add the ariake.icls file into `~/Library/Preferences/PhpStorm2016.*/colors` - make sure you update the PhpStorm/Webstorm version
 in the path
2. Open PhpStorm, go to: File->Settings then choose Editor->Colors & Fonts and your new theme-color appears in the select list.

**Windows**

1. Add the ariake.icls file into `C:\Users\USERNAME\.PhpStorm2016.1\config\colors` - make sure you update the PhpStorm/Webstorm version
 in the path. Place
2. Open PhpStorm, go to: File->Settings then choose Editor->Colors & Fonts and your new theme-color appears in the select list.

I use the [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font, which works well for this theme.

I also recommend using the ColorIDE plugin which will match the background of your editor with the background of the rest of the
IDE.

Please a an issue if you want me to add further styles for other languages.
